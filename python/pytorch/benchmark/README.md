# This folder contains a pytorch benchmark script based on Horovod example [code](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/blob/master/examples/pytorch_synthetic_benchmark.py)

The code could successfully run on [horovod image](https://hub.docker.com/r/horovod/horovod), _0.16.4-tf1.14.0-torch1.1.0-mxnet1.4.1-py3.6_ and _0.16.4-tf1.12.0-torch1.1.0-mxnet1.4.1-py3.5_. It should be working on other image with pytorch 1.0+ too.
